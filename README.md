# amount-fraud-transaction-detection-using-machine-learning
This project is focus on finding the fraud transactions occuring in the banks and other entities
In machine learning we use supervised learning algorithm
Here we use bagging technique that combines two or more algorithm to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction
Supervised learning algorithm: 
      Decission tree,
      Random Forest
